; This command asks the solver to check the satisfiability of your query
; If you wrote a sound transformer, the solver should say 'unsat'
(check-sat)
; If the solver returns 'sat', uncommenting the line below will give you the values of the various variables that violate the soundness property. This will help you debug your solution.
